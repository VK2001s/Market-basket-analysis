# Market-basket-analysis
This project implements the Apriori algorithm to perform market basket analysis.
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used to identify patterns and associations among items frequently purchased together by customers. 
It is commonly used in retail and e-commerce businesses to improve product recommendations, optimize store layouts, and enhance marketing strategies.

## Software and Tools Requrements
1. [Github Account](https://github.com)
2. [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [GitCLl](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transactional data, where each row represents a unique transaction and the items purchased in that transaction. 
The dataset contains columns as follows:

•	Invoice No: Invoice number for each transaction

•	Stock Code: Unique identifier for each product

•	Description: Description of the product

•	Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased in the transaction

•	Invoice Date: Date of the transaction

# Results
The results of the Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm will be displayed in the output of the code. This includes the generated association rules, support, confidence, and lift values for each rule.

# Further Improvements
You can experiment with different minimum support, confidence, and lift thresholds to discover different levels of item associations.

Visualize the association rules using charts or graphs to make them more interpretable and understandable.

Apply post-processing techniques such as pruning or filtering to refine the generated rules and focus on the most relevant and actionable ones.
